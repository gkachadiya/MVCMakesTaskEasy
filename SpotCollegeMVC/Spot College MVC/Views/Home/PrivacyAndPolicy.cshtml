                                        <b>2.</b> Use of Information
In connection with the SpotCollege Sites, the information you supply to SpotCollege enables us to provide the college search and matching services which you select by matching your background to the admission requirements and/or preferred student backgrounds of colleges and universities. Participating colleges and universities may search the non-personally identifiable information of users (such as grade point averages or class standing, but not names or addresses) in order to decide which users they are interested in having apply for admission. SpotCollege may also recommend certain colleges and universities to students, and we will use a similar methodology to select which students should be informed of those opportunities. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not share any of your personally identifiable information with colleges or universities without your consent. If you appear to be a viable candidate for admission to a college or university, a notice will be placed in your message in-box in the college center on our website, and we will send you an email that may contain a link to your message in-box. Once you have reviewed the notice in your message in-box, you may give us permission to release your contact information to such college or university so that they may directly contact you.
In addition, SpotCollege uses your information in order to customize our SpotCollege Site(s) to your interests and enhance your overall experience and to customize advertising that you may see on a SpotCollege Site. SpotCollege uses various methods to recognize you, including the use of cookies and requesting your e-mail address and password before accessing our site. Once SpotCollege recognizes you, pages, advertisements, including advertisements and offers in your college center, and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most. In addition, as described above, SpotCollege utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our site(s). This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content and Web analytics partners. This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.

If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then personally identifiable information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for such third party service provider to provide these services. These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information only for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by SpotCollege. These third party service providers have agreed to hold and use your confidential information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our site, which are governed by a more specific provision below.

Links to Other Sites - You may find on a SpotCollege Site links to third party websites in a format that enables us to keep track of where those links have been followed. This Privacy Policy applies only to the SpotCollege Sit. As we do not control other sites to which we may link, they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Please realize that we do not control the information provided by you to any other third party site to which you may link from a SpotCollege Site.
